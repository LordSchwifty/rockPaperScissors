## Context
- I am a student in my 5th weekof the Turing School of Software and Design front-end program. We had 7 days to complete this project and I spent about 20 hours of work time.

## Challenges
- I ran through some challenges in the beginning of linking the data model with the DOM and styling with display flex.

## Wins
- There were a lot of instances that felt like wins for me. But one of the biggest wins was smoothly updating the DOM and making the game playable through the data model.
